## Agent Prompt

You are tasked with installing Framer Motion for the Eleven Emmons vacation rental website.

**Context:**
- This is a Next.js 14 App Router project
- Uses TypeScript and React 18
- This is the foundation task for EPIC-002: Animation Framework
- All future animation work depends on this installation

**Instructions:**

1. **Install Framer Motion:**
   - Run: `npm install framer-motion`
   - Wait for installation to complete
   - Check for any peer dependency warnings or errors

2. **Verify Installation:**
   - Check that `package.json` now includes framer-motion in dependencies
   - Note the version that was installed
   - Ensure package-lock.json was updated

3. **Test Import (Optional Verification):**
   - You can verify the installation works by checking if the import is available
   - Do NOT create any actual components yet - that's for later tasks
   - Just confirm the package is accessible

4. **Report Results:**
   - Confirm successful installation
   - Note the version installed
   - Report any warnings or issues encountered

**Important Notes:**
- This is a production dependency, not a dev dependency
- Do NOT install any additional packages at this time
- Do NOT start implementing animations yet - this is just installation
- If there are any peer dependency warnings, note them but they're likely okay

**Success Criteria:**
- Framer Motion appears in package.json dependencies
- No installation errors
- Ready for next task (creating animation utilities)
