# US-001: Setup Animation Infrastructure

## User Story

**As a** developer
**I want** to set up the animation infrastructure with Framer Motion
**So that** I can implement consistent, performant animations across the website

## Description

This user story establishes the foundation for all animation work. It involves installing Framer Motion, creating reusable animation utilities, defining animation constants, and building animated wrapper components that will be used throughout the site.

## Priority

**CRITICAL** - Foundation for all animation work

## Estimated Effort

1 day (8 hours)

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Framer Motion installed and configured in package.json
- [ ] `/lib/animations/variants.ts` created with reusable animation variants
- [ ] `/lib/animations/hooks.ts` created with custom animation hooks
- [ ] `/lib/animations/constants.ts` created with timing/easing constants
- [ ] `/components/animated/AnimatedSection.tsx` created and tested
- [ ] `/components/animated/AnimatedCard.tsx` created and tested
- [ ] `/components/animated/AnimatedButton.tsx` created and tested
- [ ] All utilities support `prefers-reduced-motion` accessibility
- [ ] TypeScript types properly defined for all utilities
- [ ] Documentation added for animation utilities

## Technical Notes

### Animation Principles

- **Duration**: 300-600ms for most animations
- **Easing**: easeOut for entrances, easeIn for exits
- **Stagger**: 50-100ms between sequential elements
- **Threshold**: Trigger at 10-20% visibility
- **Once**: Most animations trigger once (triggerOnce: true)

### Server/Client Boundaries

- Wrapper components must be client components ('use client')
- Use composition pattern to keep server components where possible
- Only wrap necessary parts that need animations

### Performance Considerations

- Use CSS transforms (GPU-accelerated): translateY, scale, opacity
- Implement `will-change` strategically
- Avoid animating layout properties (width, height, padding, margin)
- Use `viewport={{ once: true }}` to prevent repeated animations

## Dependencies

- Next.js 14 App Router (✅ installed)
- React 18 (✅ installed)
- TypeScript (✅ installed)

## Related Files

- `/lib/animations/` (to be created)
- `/components/animated/` (to be created)

## Tasks

1. [TASK-001](./tasks/TASK-001.md) - Install Framer Motion package
2. [TASK-002](./tasks/TASK-002.md) - Create animation utilities and constants
3. [TASK-003](./tasks/TASK-003.md) - Create custom animation hooks
4. [TASK-004](./tasks/TASK-004.md) - Create animated wrapper components

## Success Metrics

- All utilities created and properly typed
- No TypeScript errors
- Animation utilities accessible from other components
- Reduced motion support verified
