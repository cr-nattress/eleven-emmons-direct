# US-009: Implement Header and Footer Animations

## User Story

**As a** visitor navigating the site
**I want** to see smooth animations in the header and footer
**So that** the entire page feels cohesive and polished

## Description

Implement entrance animations for the header navigation and footer sections. These persistent elements should have subtle animations that enhance the overall experience without being distracting.

## Priority

**LOW** - Nice to have for polish

## Estimated Effort

6 hours

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Header appears with smooth entrance animation on page load
- [ ] Desktop navigation links have subtle entrance
- [ ] Footer sections animate when scrolled into view
- [ ] All animations respect reduced motion preferences
- [ ] Navigation functionality maintained
- [ ] No impact on header scroll behavior

## Technical Notes

### Current Structure

- Header at `/components/Header.tsx` (may already have 'use client' from US-006)
- Footer at `/components/Footer.tsx`
- Header may have sticky/fixed positioning
- Footer has multiple sections (links, contact, social, etc.)

### Animation Targets

1. **Header**: Logo and navigation links (page load)
2. **Desktop Nav Links**: Subtle stagger on load
3. **Footer Sections**: Each section on scroll

## Dependencies

- US-001: Setup Animation Infrastructure
- US-006: Mobile Menu Animations (Header already has 'use client')
