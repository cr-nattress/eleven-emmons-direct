# EPIC-002: Implement Animation Framework

## Epic Overview

Implement a comprehensive animation framework using Framer Motion to enhance user engagement, improve perceived performance, and increase booking conversions through strategic animations across all sections of the vacation rental website.

## Business Value

### Primary Goals
- **Increase Conversion Rate**: 15-25% improvement in booking CTA clicks
- **Improve User Engagement**: 30-45% improvement in time-on-page
- **Enhance Perceived Performance**: Better user experience through smooth transitions
- **Professional Polish**: Match premium property positioning with premium UX

### Key Metrics
- Booking button click-through rate
- Average session duration
- Scroll depth
- Bounce rate reduction
- Mobile engagement metrics

## Scope

### In Scope
- Framer Motion installation and configuration
- Animation utilities and shared components
- Hero section entrance animations (critical path)
- Booking CTA animations (conversion-focused)
- Gallery animations (high engagement)
- Amenities section animations
- Mobile menu animations
- About and Location section animations
- Header and Footer polish animations
- Performance optimization and testing

### Out of Scope
- Page transition animations (no multi-page routing currently)
- Complex timeline-based animations (over-engineering)
- Video animations or Lottie files
- Third-party animation services

## Technical Approach

### Technology Stack
- **Primary**: Framer Motion (best React animation library)
- **Secondary**: Native Intersection Observer API (scroll triggers)
- **Fallback**: Tailwind CSS animations (simple hover states)

### Architecture
```
/lib
  /animations
    - variants.ts          # Reusable animation variants
    - hooks.ts            # Custom animation hooks
    - constants.ts        # Duration, easing, delays

/components
  /animated
    - AnimatedSection.tsx  # Wrapper for sections
    - AnimatedCard.tsx     # Wrapper for cards
    - AnimatedButton.tsx   # Wrapper for CTAs
```

### Animation Principles
- **Duration**: 300-600ms for most animations (feels natural)
- **Easing**: easeOut for entrances, easeIn for exits
- **Stagger**: 50-100ms between sequential elements
- **Threshold**: Trigger at 10-20% visibility for scroll animations
- **Once**: Most animations trigger once (triggerOnce: true)

## User Stories

### Critical Path (Week 1)
- **US-001**: Setup Animation Infrastructure
- **US-002**: Implement Hero Section Animations
- **US-003**: Implement Gallery Animations
- **US-004**: Implement Booking CTA Animations

### High Priority (Week 2)
- **US-005**: Implement Amenities Section Animations
- **US-006**: Implement Mobile Menu Animations
- **US-007**: Implement About Section Animations

### Medium Priority (Week 3)
- **US-008**: Implement Location Section Animations
- **US-009**: Implement Header and Footer Animations
- **US-010**: Testing and Performance Optimization

## Dependencies

### Technical Dependencies
- Next.js 14 App Router (✅ Already installed)
- React 18 (✅ Already installed)
- TypeScript (✅ Already installed)
- Framer Motion (❌ To be installed)

### Content Dependencies
- All components must remain server components where possible
- Client components only when absolutely necessary ('use client')
- MDX content must remain functional

## Acceptance Criteria

### Must Have
- [x] Framer Motion installed and configured
- [x] Animation utilities created and documented
- [x] Hero section has smooth entrance animations
- [x] Booking CTA has attention-grabbing animations
- [x] Gallery cards have staggered entrance animations
- [x] Mobile menu animates smoothly on open/close
- [x] All critical animations have fallbacks for reduced motion
- [x] Lighthouse performance score remains above 90

### Should Have
- [x] All sections have scroll-triggered animations
- [x] All buttons have enhanced hover animations
- [x] Cards have staggered entrance patterns
- [x] Icons animate on parent interactions
- [x] Smooth transitions between all states

### Could Have
- [ ] Parallax effects on Hero section
- [ ] Letter-by-letter text reveal animations
- [ ] Custom easing curves for brand personality
- [ ] Animation variants for A/B testing

## Risks and Mitigation

### Risk 1: Performance Impact
**Risk**: Animations could slow down page load or runtime performance
**Mitigation**:
- Use CSS transforms (GPU-accelerated)
- Implement `will-change` CSS property strategically
- Test on low-end devices
- Monitor Lighthouse scores after each phase

### Risk 2: Server/Client Component Boundaries
**Risk**: Converting server components to client components for animations
**Mitigation**:
- Wrap only necessary parts in client components
- Use composition pattern (AnimatedWrapper components)
- Keep data fetching in server components

### Risk 3: Accessibility
**Risk**: Animations could cause motion sickness or distraction
**Mitigation**:
- Respect `prefers-reduced-motion` media query
- Keep animations subtle (300-600ms)
- Use `triggerOnce: true` to avoid repeated animations

### Risk 4: Mobile Performance
**Risk**: Animations could lag on mobile devices
**Mitigation**:
- Test on real devices (iOS and Android)
- Use lighter animations on mobile
- Disable complex animations on low-end devices

## Success Metrics

### Before/After Comparison

| Metric | Current | Target | Measurement |
|--------|---------|--------|-------------|
| Booking CTA Click Rate | Baseline | +20% | Google Analytics events |
| Average Session Duration | Baseline | +35% | GA4 engagement |
| Scroll Depth (% reaching booking) | Baseline | +25% | GA4 scroll tracking |
| Bounce Rate | Baseline | -15% | GA4 bounce rate |
| Mobile Engagement | Baseline | +30% | GA4 mobile metrics |

### Phase-Specific Metrics

**Phase 1 (Critical)**:
- Hero entrance improves time to first interaction
- Booking CTA click rate increases by 10-15%

**Phase 2 (High)**:
- Gallery engagement increases by 20-25%
- Mobile menu interactions feel premium

**Phase 3 (Medium)**:
- Overall scroll depth increases by 15-20%
- User satisfaction (qualitative feedback)

## Notes

- This epic focuses on **conversion-driven animations** rather than decorative effects
- Priority is on **mobile experience** as majority of vacation rental traffic is mobile
- All animations must **respect user preferences** (prefers-reduced-motion)
- Code should be **reusable and maintainable** through shared animation variants
- Performance must not degrade - target is **95+ Lighthouse score maintained**
