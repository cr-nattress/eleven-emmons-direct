3. **Systematic Testing Process:**

   For each component:
   1. **Load**: Navigate to section
   2. **Observe**: Watch animation play
   3. **Measure**: Use DevTools Performance tab
   4. **Interact**: Tap/touch elements
   5. **Document**: Note any issues

4. **Measure Frame Rate:**

   **Chrome DevTools on Device:**
   1. Connect Android device via USB
   2. Enable USB debugging
   3. Chrome → chrome://inspect → Inspect device
   4. DevTools → Performance tab
   5. Record while scrolling/interacting
   6. Check FPS meter

   **Safari on iOS:**
   1. Connect iPhone via USB
   2. Enable Web Inspector on device
   3. Safari (Mac) → Develop → [Device] → [Page]
   4. Timeline tab → Record
   5. Check frame rate

5. **Test Common Mobile Issues:**

   **Issue: Jank during scroll**
   - Cause: Too many animations triggering at once
   - Check: Scroll performance tab for dropped frames
   - Fix: Reduce concurrent animations

   **Issue: Menu slide stutters**
   - Cause: Heavy animation during slide
   - Check: Menu slide performance
   - Fix: Simplify animation or reduce backdrop complexity

   **Issue: Lightbox slow to open**
   - Cause: Large images or complex animation
   - Check: Image sizes and animation complexity
   - Fix: Optimize images or simplify animation

   **Issue: Hover effects stuck**
   - Cause: Touch triggers hover state
   - Check: Tap and hold on elements
   - Fix: Use `@media (hover: hover)` for hover effects

6. **Performance Optimization Checklist:**

   If performance is poor:
   - [ ] Check for layout thrashing
   - [ ] Verify GPU acceleration (use will-change or transform)
   - [ ] Reduce animation complexity
   - [ ] Limit concurrent animations
   - [ ] Check image sizes
   - [ ] Profile with DevTools

**Expected Results:**

✅ **Excellent Performance:**
- 60fps all animations
- No jank or stuttering
- Instant touch response
- Smooth throughout

✅ **Good Performance:**
- 50-60fps most animations
- Occasional minor jank (barely noticeable)
- Good touch response
- Overall smooth experience

⚠️ **Needs Work:**
- 40-50fps
- Noticeable jank
- Some stuttering
- Needs optimization

❌ **Poor Performance:**
- <40fps
- Constant jank
- Stuttering
- Unusable on mobile
- Critical optimization needed

**Deliverables:**
1. Complete `/docs/mobile-testing-report.md` with all results
2. Performance recordings/screenshots (optional)
3. List of mobile-specific issues (if any)
4. Recommendations for optimization
5. Final verdict: PASS or NEEDS OPTIMIZATION

**Success Criteria:**
- Tested on at least 2 devices (iOS and Android)
- All animations smooth (50+ fps acceptable, 60fps ideal)
- No critical jank or stuttering
- Touch interactions work correctly
- Mobile menu smooth and responsive
- Test report completed with findings
