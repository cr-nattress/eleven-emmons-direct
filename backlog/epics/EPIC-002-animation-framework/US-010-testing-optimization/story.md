# US-010: Testing and Performance Optimization

## User Story

**As a** developer and site owner
**I want** to ensure all animations perform well and are accessible
**So that** the site maintains high performance scores and works for all users

## Description

Comprehensive testing and optimization of all implemented animations. Run performance audits, test accessibility features, verify mobile performance, and fix any issues found. This is the final quality assurance step before considering the animation framework complete.

## Priority

**CRITICAL** - Must pass before launch

## Estimated Effort

1 day (6-8 hours)

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Lighthouse performance score maintained at 95+ (desktop)
- [ ] Lighthouse performance score 90+ (mobile)
- [ ] All animations respect prefers-reduced-motion
- [ ] No animation jank on mobile devices
- [ ] No layout shift (CLS) issues from animations
- [ ] All accessibility tests pass
- [ ] Bundle size impact documented
- [ ] All animations tested on target devices

## Technical Notes

### Testing Areas

1. **Performance**: Lighthouse audits, frame rate monitoring
2. **Accessibility**: Reduced motion, keyboard navigation, screen readers
3. **Mobile**: Test on actual devices, various screen sizes
4. **Cross-browser**: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge

### Performance Targets

- Lighthouse Performance: 95+ (desktop), 90+ (mobile)
- First Contentful Paint: <1.5s
- Time to Interactive: <3s
- Cumulative Layout Shift: <0.1
- 60fps animations (no jank)

### Optimization Strategies

- Lazy load animations for below-fold content
- Reduce motion complexity if performance issues
- Optimize animation variants
- Check bundle size impact

## Dependencies

- US-001 through US-009: All animations implemented

## Related Files

- All component files with animations
- `/lib/animations/*` - Animation utilities
- `package.json` - Check bundle size

## Tasks

1. [TASK-001](./tasks/TASK-001.md) - Run Lighthouse performance audit
2. [TASK-002](./tasks/TASK-002.md) - Test reduced motion support
3. [TASK-003](./tasks/TASK-003.md) - Test on mobile devices
4. [TASK-004](./tasks/TASK-004.md) - Fix any performance issues found

## Success Metrics

- All Lighthouse scores meet targets
- No animation-related accessibility issues
- Smooth performance on mobile
- User feedback positive
- No increase in bounce rate

## Business Impact

- Maintains site performance
- Ensures accessibility compliance
- Professional quality assurance
- Prevents performance-related issues at launch
