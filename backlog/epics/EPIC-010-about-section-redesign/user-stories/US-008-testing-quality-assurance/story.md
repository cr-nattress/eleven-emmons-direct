- **Previous:** US-007 (Content migration and copywriting)
- **Next:** None (final story in epic)
- **Related:** All stories (testing validates all work)

## Notes

- Run tests iteratively as features are built (don't wait until the end)
- Fix issues as they're discovered (don't batch fixes)
- Use automated tools where possible (Lighthouse, WAVE, axe)
- Manual testing required for screen readers and real device testing
- Document any known issues or limitations
- Create issue tickets for post-MVP enhancements

## Testing Tools

### Automated Testing

1. **Lighthouse** (Chrome DevTools): Performance, accessibility, SEO
2. **WAVE** (Browser extension): Accessibility checker
3. **axe DevTools** (Browser extension): Accessibility validation
4. **WebAIM Contrast Checker**: Color contrast validation

### Manual Testing

1. **Screen Readers:**
   - NVDA (Windows, free)
   - VoiceOver (Mac, built-in)
   - JAWS (Windows, paid)

2. **Browser DevTools:**
   - Chrome DevTools (device emulation)
   - Firefox Developer Tools
   - Safari Web Inspector

3. **Real Devices:**
   - iPhone (iOS Safari)
   - Android phone (Chrome)
   - iPad (Safari)

### Build & Code Quality

1. **TypeScript:** `npm run type-check` or `tsc --noEmit`
2. **ESLint:** `npm run lint`
3. **Prettier:** `npm run format`
4. **Build:** `npm run build`
5. **Dev Server:** `npm run dev`

## Post-Testing Actions

After all tests pass:

1. **Code Review:** Request review from team member
2. **Documentation:** Update README and component docs
3. **Changelog:** Add entry to CHANGELOG.md
4. **Deployment:** Deploy to staging first, then production
5. **Monitoring:** Watch analytics for conversion rate changes
6. **User Testing:** Collect feedback from real users
