# TASK-001: Create About.tsx Component File with Basic Structure

**Task ID:** TASK-001
**User Story:** US-001 - Create About Component Structure
**Epic:** EPIC-010 - About Section Redesign
**Status:** ðŸ“‹ To Do
**Estimated Time:** 15-20 minutes
**Priority:** ðŸ”´ Critical (High)

## Task Description

Create the foundational `About.tsx` component file in the components directory with proper TypeScript structure, imports, and a basic export function. This establishes the foundation for all subsequent About section development.

---

## Agent Prompt

You are implementing the About section redesign for the 11 Emmons Road vacation rental website.

**Goal**: Create the `About.tsx` component file with proper Next.js 14 App Router structure and TypeScript typing.

**Context**: This is the first step in building the About section. We're using Next.js 14's App Router with server components (the default). The component will be server-rendered and doesn't require client-side JavaScript at this stage.

**Instructions**:

1. **Create the component file:**
   - File path: `components/About.tsx`
   - Use TypeScript (`.tsx` extension)
   - Do NOT add `"use client"` directive (server component by default)

2. **Add basic structure:**

   ```typescript
   // components/About.tsx
   export default function About() {
     return (
       <div>
         {/* Component content will be added in next tasks */}
       </div>
     )
   }
   ```

3. **Verify the file:**
   - Check that TypeScript has no errors
   - Ensure file is saved in correct location

**Implementation Details**:

- **File location:** `components/About.tsx`
- **Component type:** Server Component (default in Next.js 14 App Router)
- **Export type:** Default export
- **TypeScript:** No prop types needed yet (component takes no props)

**Expected Code:**

```typescript
// components/About.tsx

export default function About() {
  return (
    <div>
      {/* About section content */}
    </div>
  )
}
```

**Verification**:

1. File exists at `components/About.tsx`
2. TypeScript shows no errors (run `npm run type-check` if available)
3. No ESLint errors
4. File follows project code style

**Expected Outcome**:

- âœ… `About.tsx` file created in `components/` directory
- âœ… File contains basic component structure
- âœ… No TypeScript or ESLint errors
- âœ… Component ready for section container implementation (TASK-002)

**Commit Message**:

```
feat(about): Create About component with basic structure

- Add About.tsx component file
- Use Next.js 14 App Router server component pattern
- Set up foundation for About section implementation
```

---

## Notes

- Keep it simple - just create the basic file structure
- Next task (TASK-002) will add the section container and styling
- No need to add any content or styling yet
- Server component is the default (no "use client" needed)
