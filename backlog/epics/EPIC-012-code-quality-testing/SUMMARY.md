## Risk Assessment

### High Risk (Mitigation Required)

- **Testing (US-001):** Large time investment, critical for CI/CD
  - _Mitigation:_ Start with high-value tests, incremental coverage
  - _Fallback:_ Implement basic smoke tests if time-constrained

### Medium Risk

- **CI/CD (US-005):** GitHub Actions complexity
  - _Mitigation:_ Start with simple workflow, add complexity iteratively
- **Accessibility (US-009):** Requires manual testing with assistive tech
  - _Mitigation:_ Use automated tools first, manual testing for critical paths

### Low Risk

- US-002, 003, 004, 006, 007, 008, 010 - Well-defined, low complexity

## Dependencies & Blockers

**Blocking Relationships:**

- US-005 (CI/CD) **requires** US-001 (Tests must exist to run in CI)

**All other stories are independent and can be executed in parallel**

## Team Notes

### For Developers

- **Quick Wins First:** US-002, 003, 004 can be done in one session
- **Testing is Foundation:** US-001 enables confident refactoring
- **CI/CD is Force Multiplier:** US-005 pays dividends immediately
- **Incremental Approach:** Epic can be executed one story at a time

### For Project Managers

- **Total Effort:** 20-30 hours (adjust based on team size/experience)
- **ROI:** High - reduces deployment risk, improves maintainability
- **Priority:** Critical for production launch
- **Flexibility:** Stories 6-10 can be deferred if time-constrained

### For Stakeholders

- **Business Value:** Reduced deployment risk, faster feature velocity
- **Quality:** Professional-grade codebase ready for scaling
- **Compliance:** WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility (legal requirement)
- **Performance:** Better SEO, improved conversion rates
