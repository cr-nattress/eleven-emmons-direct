# TASK-002: Create Final Git Commit

**Task ID:** TASK-002
**User Story:** US-009 - Cleanup and Finalization
**Status:** To Do
**Estimated Time:** 10 minutes

## Task Description

Create a comprehensive git commit documenting the MDX migration with a clear commit message.

## Agent Prompt

```
Create a git commit for the MDX migration:

1. **Check git status** to see all changed files:
```bash
git status
```

2. **Review the changes**:
```bash
git diff
```

3. **Stage all migration-related files**:
```bash
git add lib/markdown.ts
git add components/mdx-components.tsx
git add components/mdx-remote-client.tsx
git add components/About.tsx
git add components/Amenities.tsx
git add components/Location.tsx
git add package.json
git add package-lock.json
```

4. **Create commit with descriptive message**:
```bash
git commit -m "Migrate from marked to next-mdx-remote for MDX support

- Replace marked with next-mdx-remote for content rendering
- Add MDX component mapping with custom shortcodes (Callout, BookingCTA, FeatureHighlight)
- Create MDXClient wrapper for server component compatibility
- Update About, Amenities, and Location components to use MDX rendering
- Configure remark-gfm for GitHub Flavored Markdown
- Configure rehype-slug and rehype-autolink-headings for better navigation
- Add rehype-pretty-code for syntax highlighting
- Remove marked dependency

This enables embedding React components in markdown content while maintaining
the same SSG architecture and improving content authoring capabilities.

```

5. **Verify commit**:
```bash
git log -1 --stat
```

This shows the commit message and files changed.

6. **Optional - Push to remote** (if working with a team):
```bash
git push origin [branch-name]

**Alternative using git commit editor for detailed message**:

```bash
