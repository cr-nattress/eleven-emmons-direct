# Skill: Generate Backlog from Requirements

Generate a complete backlog with epics, user stories, and task prompts from a requirements document.

## Usage

```bash
# Option 1: Direct path to requirements document
generate-backlog path/to/requirements.md

# Option 2: Specify epic number
generate-backlog path/to/requirements.md --epic-number 009
```

## What This Skill Does

This skill automatically analyzes a requirements or feature document and generates a complete, structured backlog including:

1. **Epic files** with business value, acceptance criteria, and ROI projections
2. **User story files** with acceptance criteria and story points
3. **Task files** with detailed agent prompts for AI execution
4. **Directory structure** following best practices
5. **Summary/overview document** with quick start guide

## Analysis Strategy

### Phase 1: Document Analysis

**Read and understand the requirements document:**

1. **Identify the main goal** - What is the overarching objective?
2. **Extract key features** - What are the distinct features or capabilities needed?
3. **Understand dependencies** - What work depends on other work?
4. **Assess complexity** - How long will each piece take?
5. **Determine business value** - What's the ROI or impact?

### Phase 2: Epic Decomposition

**Break requirements into epics (major features/initiatives):**

Rules for Epic creation:

- Each epic = 1 major feature or capability
- Target: 4-8 hours of work per epic
- Should deliver standalone business value
- Can be prioritized independently

**Epic components to generate:**

```
- Epic ID (EPIC-XXX)
- Title (clear, action-oriented)
- Business Value (why this matters)
- Current State vs Target State
- Technical Approach (high-level how)
- User Stories (3-9 stories per epic)
- Acceptance Criteria (measurable outcomes)
- Risks and Mitigations
- Success Metrics
- Estimated Story Points (sum of user stories)
```

### Phase 3: User Story Creation

**Break each epic into user stories (features/capabilities):**

Rules for User Story creation:

- Each story = 1 specific capability or improvement
- Target: 30 minutes to 2 hours of work per story
- Follow format: "As a [who], I want [what], so that [why]"
- Assign story points (1, 2, 3, 5, 8 using Fibonacci)

**Story components to generate:**

```
- Story ID (US-XXX)
- Epic reference
- User story statement
- Acceptance Criteria (4-8 specific criteria)
- Story Points (effort estimate)
- Priority (High/Medium/Low)
- Technical Notes (implementation hints)
- Definition of Done
- Tasks (3-6 tasks per story)
```

### Phase 4: Task Prompt Creation

**Break each user story into actionable tasks:**

Rules for Task creation:

- Each task = 1 atomic action
- Target: 5-30 minutes of work per task
- Must be executable by AI or human
- Include verification steps

**Task components to generate:**

```
- Task ID (TASK-XXX)
- User Story reference
- Task Description (what to do)
- Agent Prompt (detailed instructions for AI)
- Commands to Execute (bash/code)
- Verification Steps (how to confirm done)
- Expected Output (what success looks like)
- Estimated Time
```

## Story Point Guidelines

Use Fibonacci sequence for estimation:

- **1 point**: 15-30 minutes, trivial change
  - Update a config value
  - Add a simple alt text
  - Install a package

- **2 points**: 30-60 minutes, straightforward change
  - Update a component with known pattern
  - Write a simple function
  - Configure a service

- **3 points**: 1-2 hours, moderate complexity
  - Build a new component with state
  - Integrate an API
  - Write comprehensive content

- **5 points**: 2-4 hours, significant complexity
  - Design and implement a feature
  - Complex business logic
  - Multi-component integration

- **8 points**: 4-8 hours, high complexity
  - Major architectural change
  - Multiple interconnected features
  - Research + implementation

## Priority Guidelines

**ðŸ”´ Critical (High)**:

- Blocks other work
- Urgent business need
- Quick wins with high impact
- Week 1 priorities

**ðŸŸ¡ Medium**:

- Important but not blocking
- Weeks 2-4 work
- Moderate business impact

**ðŸŸ¢ Low**:

- Nice to have
- Future iterations
- Polish and refinement

## Prompt Template Structure

For each task, generate an "Agent Prompt" section that can be directly copy-pasted to an AI coding assistant:

```markdown
## Agent Prompt

You are working on [EPIC-XXX: Epic Title].

**Goal**: [Clear, specific goal]

**Context**: [Why this task matters, what it's part of]

**Instructions**:

1. [Step 1 with specific details]
2. [Step 2 with file paths and code snippets]
3. [Step 3 with expected outcomes]

**Implementation Details**:

- File to modify: `path/to/file.ts`
- Specific changes: [exact changes needed]
- Code example:
  \`\`\`typescript
  // Example of what to implement
  \`\`\`

1. Run: `npm run dev`
2. Check: [specific behavior to verify]
3. Test: [how to test the change]

**Expected Outcome**: [Specific, measurable result]

**Commit Message**: `type(scope): description`
```

## Directory Structure Template

Generate this structure:

```
backlog/epics/

   - aggregateRating: 4.98 out of 5
   - amenityFeature: ["WiFi", "Kitchen", "Parking", "Ski Storage"]
   - geo: lat/long coordinates

**Implementation**:

File: `app/layout.tsx`

Add this script tag to the <head>:

\`\`\`typescript

<script
  type="application/ld+json"
  dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{
    __html: JSON.stringify({
      "@context": "https://schema.org",
      "@type": "VacationRental",
      "name": "11 Emmons Road - Ski-In/Ski-Out Crested Butte",
      "address": {
        "@type": "PostalAddress",
        "streetAddress": "11 Emmons Road, Unit 324",
        "addressLocality": "Crested Butte",
        "addressRegion": "CO",
        "postalCode": "81224"
      },
      "aggregateRating": {
        "@type": "AggregateRating",
        "ratingValue": "4.98",
        "reviewCount": "127"
      }
    })
  }}
/>
\`\`\`

**Verification**:
1. Run: `npm run dev`
2. Visit: http://localhost:3000
3. View source and confirm JSON-LD is present
4. Test with: https://search.google.com/test/rich-results
5. Confirm no errors in Rich Results Test

**Expected Outcome**:
